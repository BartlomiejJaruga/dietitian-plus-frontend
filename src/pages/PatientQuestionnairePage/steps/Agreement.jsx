			<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					Welcome to Dietitian+ ("we", "us", or "our"). By accessing or using our platform, website, mobile application, or any related services (collectively, the "Service"), you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms & Conditions ("Terms"). Please read them carefully before using the Service.
				</p>
				<p>If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must not use our Service.</p>

				<h2>2. Nature of the Service</h2>
				<p>
					Dietitian+ is a platform designed to connect users ("Clients") with certified dietitians ("Dietitians") for the purpose of dietary guidance, health planning, and nutrition-related communication. We provide the infrastructure to facilitate this interaction, but we do not provide medical advice, diagnoses, or treatments ourselves.
				</p>
				<p>
					All information, guidance, and plans are prepared and delivered by third-party dietitians registered within the platform. Dietitian+ does not employ these professionals, nor does it directly supervise, evaluate, or certify their qualifications beyond basic onboarding verification.
				</p>

				<h2>3. No Medical Liability</h2>
				<p>
					Dietitian+ is not a medical service. The Service is not intended to replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition or dietary restriction.
				</p>
				<p>
					In case of emergency or severe reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis, severe allergic reaction, or any medical emergency), you must contact local emergency services immediately. Dietitian+ is not liable for any medical emergencies or consequences arising from the use of the platform.

					<li>Dietary preferences or restrictions</li>
				</ul>
				<p>

You acknowledge that failure to provide accurate data may result in health risks, and that Dietitian+ is not responsible for any outcomes resulting from such false or incomplete data.
				</p>

				<h2>5. Liability Disclaimer</h2>
				<p>
					While we strive to connect users with qualified dietitians, Dietitian+ does not guarantee the effectiveness, safety, or suitability of any diet, recommendation, product, or service offered through the platform.

					<li>Any adverse health effects or outcomes resulting from a diet plan</li>
					<li>Allergic reactions, deficiencies, or medical conditions caused by following dietary guidance through the platform</li>
				</ul>
				<p>All users engage with dietitians and follow nutritional plans at their own risk.</p>

				<h2>6. Professional Conduct of Dietitians</h2>
				<p>
					Dietitians using the platform are expected to act in accordance with the professional standards of their country or jurisdiction. Dietitian+ does not take responsibility for:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Inaccurate or harmful recommendations made by a Dietitian</li>
					<li>Unethical or unprofessional behavior by any registered professional</li>
					<li>Lack of qualifications, certification, or experience beyond the scope of our internal verification process</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					We reserve the right to suspend or remove any Dietitian from the platform if credible concerns are raised. However, we are not liable for their conduct or outcomes.
				</p>

				<h2>7. Data Privacy and Processing</h2>

					<li>Request data deletion</li>
					<li>Withdraw consent at any time (which may affect your ability to use the service)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>For more information, see our full Privacy Policy.</p>

				<h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
				<p>
					To the fullest extent permitted by law, Dietitian+ disclaims all liability for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising from:
				</p>
				<ul>
